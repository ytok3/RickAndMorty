I checked the data coming with Postman. I determined the components and features that I will use for the interface. I decided to use MVM because there is not much business logic and page transitions in the project. I created Model with the data I got from Postman. I designed the interface after making sure that the data for the Feed Page came by writing the Service and ViewModel. I did the same control and design operations for the Detail Page. After refactoring a few times, I completed the project.
